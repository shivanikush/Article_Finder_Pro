## About the project
A writer has like 100s or 1000s of articles. He wanted to know was which article contained information about a specific topic. He asked me a script that could look inside all his articles in a computer and find those that contained a specific topic, word, and copy those to another folder that we should have created in his USB pen drive. Also, add in the files the line number where we found this particular topic

1. Extract information about a certain topic, searching all files in a certain folder
2. Create a script that does the same thing, but searching also within ALLfolders within the main folder
