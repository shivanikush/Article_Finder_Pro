Wayne’s relationship with Apple ended a year later due to financial reasons.  With minimal funds, Jobs and Wozniak needed an investor to continue production.  Mike Markkula, a retired marketing manager, provided financing and became one-third owner which led to the creation of Apple Computer Inc. The closest comparison to this small computer at the time was the Altair 8800 and the Intel microprocessors used in calculators and watches.  An improved version of the Apple 1 developed into the Apple 11, the first personal computer with graphics and a keyboard, and IBM soon followed Apple’s lead with their version of a small computer.  The market for personal computers had been primarily in the business industry.  Apple Computer sales netted $50 million by the last quarter of 1979 (Gitman & McDaniel, 2009) and Apple soon became the personal computer of choice for many small businesses and families, especially when Apple introduced the more user- friendly Macintosh computer in the 1980’s.  The Macintosh was Apple’s first major step in adapting the personal computer to the desires of corporate America.
